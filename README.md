Hi there 👋 I’m Nikita

I’m a student based in Belarus BY
I design and build whatever I can imagine.

My main tech languages are Java and JavaScript, powered by a lot of motivation 🚀
My favorite tools are Visual Studio Code, pgAdmin, and YouTube (best debugger ever).

I’ve got a bunch of pinned projects, but my favorite one is Anime Scene Gallery 🎨
If you want to learn how I build things, feel free to explore my projects here.

- Git & GitHub
- and my brain 🧠

Fun facts:

Hobbies: Gym, Building things, Learning new technologies
